This folder contains code for running the analysis. Paper figures can be re-created using scripts in the 'Figures' folder. The HPC code will run on the Imperial College high performance computing cluster, but can be adapated for local runs by lowering the population size and shortening the run-time.

'HPC_draws' refers to runs incorporating uncertainty in model parameters
'misc' scripts test ITN distributions, the number of SMC doses needed in each seasonality, and warmup-times
