Insecticide Treated Net coverage

Summary (purpose)
The table include data on ITN use. Specifically the number of people sleeping under a net the previous night.

Description (abstract)
ITNs are modelled using a Bayesian compartment model where the flux of ITNs is tracked through time. Indicators on national level use and access are obtained from this model. The national level estimates are then disaggregated using a Bayesian geostatistical model to arrive at 5km x 5km estimates of net use. 
Notes and Caveats 

ITN values were modeled at the cell-level and thus reflect within-country heterogeneity. An additional description of this product is available in Bhatt et al. (Accepted).  ELife 2015, and Bhatt et al, Nature 2015
